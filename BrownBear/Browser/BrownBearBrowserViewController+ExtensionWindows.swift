//
//  BrownBearBrowserViewController+ExtensionWindows.swift
//  BrownBear
//
//  The browser's implementation of the chrome.windows / runtime.openOptionsPage parts of
//  WebExtensionBridgeHost. iOS is single-window, so the whole windows surface collapses onto one
//  synthetic window (id 1) that always contains every open tab; windows.create degrades to opening a
//  tab (geometry, state, and focus are not expressible on iOS and are ignored). openOptionsPage
//  presents the extension's real options page (in a tab when the manifest asks for open_in_tab, else
//  as a sheet), so chrome.runtime.openOptionsPage actually navigates rather than no-opping.
//
//  Split into its own +file to stay out of +WebExtensions and under the SwiftLint length limit.
//
