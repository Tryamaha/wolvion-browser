//  TabSessionStore.swift
//  BrownBear
//
//  Persists the open NORMAL tabs (their URL + title, in order) and which one is active, so the browser
//  restores the user's tabs after the app is closed — the Safari/Chrome behavior. Without this, every
//  tab was lost on app close. Private tabs are NEVER persisted (incognito must leave no trace). Backed
//  by UserDefaults: a session is a handful of small records, written on background and read once at launch.
