//
//  A single browser tab: it owns one WKWebView and publishes its navigation state. We mirror
//  Chromium's WebState idea — the tab is the durable object; the web view is its renderer.
//  State changes are observed via KVO and pushed to a delegate so the chrome (omnibox,
//  toolbar, tab grid) can react without each surface observing WebKit directly.
