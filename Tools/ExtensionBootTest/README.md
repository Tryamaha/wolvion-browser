# Extension boot test

A headless harness that boots a Chrome/Firefox extension's **background moving part** (MV3 service
worker, or MV2 background page / scripts) through BrownBear's **real** runtime — the same
`brownbear-indexeddb.js` + `brownbear-webext-background.js` (+ acorn/esm-linker for module workers)
the app loads into the background `JSContext` — and reports every boot error and every `chrome.*`
surface the extension touched that the shim doesn't provide.

It exists to answer one question without a device: *does this extension's background actually start,
or does it throw / reference an API we don't ship?* That's the difference between an extension that
is "installable" and one that is **usable**.

## What it catches (and what it can't)

Catches, faithfully:
- module **link failures** (a module-worker graph that won't link → the worker never starts);
- top-level **throws** during background evaluation;
- **unhandled rejections** during async init;
- access to `chrome.<ns>` / `chrome.<ns>.<method>` the shim leaves **undefined** (the #1 cause of a
  silently dead background), via a recording proxy over `chrome`/`browser`.

It deliberately mirrors the device environment: the bg context is a bare `JSContext` (not a
WKWebView), so `indexedDB` comes from the bundled `fake-indexeddb` engine — the harness loads it
first, exactly like `WebExtensionBackgroundContext.boot`, so an `indexedDB is not defined` here would
be a real gap, not an artifact. Native bridges (`__bb_*`) are mocked with neutral shapes.

It does **not** render popups/options pages (that needs a DOM — see the page-boot harness) and does
not exercise real network/tabs.

## Usage

1. Unpack the extensions you want to test to `/tmp/crx/<id>/unpacked/` (each with its `manifest.json`).
2. Run the whole set:

   ```sh
   node Tools/ExtensionBootTest/run-bg.mjs            # defaults to /tmp/crx
   node Tools/ExtensionBootTest/run-bg.mjs /path/to/crx-root
   ```

   or one extension (prints a single JSON verdict line, prefixed `BBVERDICT:`):

   ```sh
   node Tools/ExtensionBootTest/boot-bg.mjs /tmp/crx/<id>/unpacked <id>
   ```

The runtime JS is resolved relative to the repo (`../../BrownBear/Resources/JS`); override with
`BB_APP_JS_DIR=/abs/path/to/Resources/JS` for an out-of-tree run.

## Reading the report

`run-bg.mjs` prints a per-extension table (✅/❌, background kind, MV, vendor) and a **root-cause
rollup**: the `chrome.*` surface touched-but-missing across the whole set (sorted by how many
extensions hit it) and the distinct boot-error signatures. Fix the top of the missing rollup in
`brownbear-webext-background.js`, re-run, watch it shrink.

## Page boot test (popup / options / overrides / devtools / side panel)

`boot-page.mjs` + `run-page.mjs` do the same for the **page** moving parts. Each page is loaded
through the real page runtime — `brownbear-idle-callback.js` + `brownbear-webext-page.js` (the page
shim that bridges `chrome.*` to the background) — and its `<script type=module>` graph is pre-linked
with the same `__bbBundlePage` the app uses (WebKit won't load module scripts over the custom
scheme, so a **link failure = a blank page** on device).

```sh
node Tools/ExtensionBootTest/run-page.mjs          # defaults to /tmp/crx
BB_STACK=1 node Tools/ExtensionBootTest/boot-page.mjs /tmp/crx/<id>/unpacked <id>   # one ext, with stacks
```

What it reliably catches:
- **module-link failures** (blank popup/options) — the highest-value signal, DOM-independent;
- **page-shim `chrome.*` gaps** — a method/enum the page reads that the page shim doesn't provide
  (e.g. `scripting.ExecutionWorld.MAIN`, `i18n.detectLanguage().then(...)`), via a recording proxy.

What it can't (and is honest about): popups run in a real WKWebView with a real DOM on device; the
harness runs against a **permissive DOM stub**, so DOM-heavy classic bundles (jQuery, webpack's
automatic `publicPath`, DOMPurify's `addHook`) throw harness-only errors that do **not** reproduce on
device. Treat the classic-script errors as best-effort; trust the **link-failure** and
**missing-`chrome.*`** signals. Bridge calls to the background don't resolve here (the booted page
has no live background), so a page that merely *awaits* data isn't flagged — only one that *throws*
or *fails to link* is.

## Full offline engine (worker + popup together)

`engine.mjs` is the real thing: it runs an extension's **background worker** (JSContext) AND its
**popup** (WKWebView) in one process, wired by a faithful re-implementation of BrownBear's native
layer — **shared `chrome.storage`**, the popup↔worker **runtime-message router**, the **port hub**,
and the **service-worker fetch** bridge. The popup↔worker handshake actually happens, so deep
cross-context bugs reproduce here instead of only on device.

```sh
node Tools/ExtensionBootTest/engine.mjs /tmp/crx/<id>/unpacked <id> [popupHtmlRel]
```

It boots the worker, fires `onInstalled`+`onStartup`, exercises the SW-fetch path (e.g. Stylus's
`/data?…`), opens the popup (running its `document.write`-injected scripts through the SW-fetch too),
then dumps the shared storage + the worker/popup logs.

Honest scope: the popup runs against a permissive DOM (no real layout), so DOM-heavy *rendering* is
best-effort — but storage, messaging, ports, and the SW-fetch path are **real**, which is where these
bugs live. It's how the `caches` / `createImageBitmap` worker gaps (Stylus) were found offline.
